## Description

This project is a back-end API for a social network app that allows users to create thoughts, react to others thoughts, and add friends. This app uses Mongoose and Express.js to help create and delete users and thoughts within the application. The routes and models build the templetes for the data created by the users throughout the app and to allow for those functions to work through the routes.
